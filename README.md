# 8-Step CD4017 Sequencer

***THIS HAS NOT BEEN FULLY MANUFACTURED OR TESTED. BUILD AT YOUR OWN RISK.***

This is a Eurorack 8-step sequencer made for a class, based off a modification of the Baby 8 sequencer. It uses a CD4017 decade counter, and a 555-based clock. You may want to mess around with the clock speed range if you decide to build it; it's maybe a little small and might not cover what you want it to. Same goes for LED brightness. They were a little bright when I breadboarded it, so test it out before assembling. 

This includes a faceplate design as a PCB file; as with the actual PCB it hasn't been manufactured yet and isn't guaranteed to be perfect. 

This was designed in KiCad 6, and all the needed files *should* be here - please feel free to contact me if I left something out.

Updates to come eventually, hopefully.
